# Work Day Scheduler/week-5-homework

* This project was my week 5 homework for school

* This site was built using HTML, CSS/Bootstrap and Javascript/jQuery

* Some of the HTML and CSS was already added in

* This site is currently live on github pages

For this assignment I was given some HTML and CSS for a work day scheduler, and I had to go in and build the rest. So all of the Javascript/jQuery was written by me, and I also added some of my own HTML and CSS. This was actually a fun and challenging project that I got done over a weekend. I may or may not come back and add onto this project, but I am happy with how it turned out!
